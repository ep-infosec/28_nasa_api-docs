                  <p><strong>You do not need to authenticate</strong> in order to
                      explore the NASA data.  However, if you will be intensively using
                      the APIs to, say, support a mobile application, then you should sign
                      up for a <a href="#signUp">NASA
                      developer key</a>.

                  <h3 id="web-service-rate-limits">Web Service Rate Limits</h3>
                  <p>Limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make
                      using your API key. Rate limits may vary by service, but the
                      defaults are:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Hourly Limit: 1,000 requests per hour</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>For each API key, these limits are applied across all
                      api.nasa.gov API requests. Exceeding these limits will lead to your
                      API key being temporarily blocked from making further requests. The
                      block will automatically be lifted by waiting an hour. If you need
                      higher rate limits, contact us.
                  </p>
                  <h3 id="demo_key-rate-limits">DEMO_KEY Rate Limits</h3>
                  <p>In documentation examples, the special DEMO_KEY api key is used.
                      This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to
                      signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so you&rsquo;re
                      encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API
                      (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO_KEY
                      are:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour</li>
                      <li>Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3 id="how-do-i-see-my-current-usage?">How Do I See My Current Usage?</h3>
                  <p>Your can check your current rate limit and usage details by
                      inspecting the <code>X-RateLimit-Limit</code>
                      and <code>X-RateLimit-Remaining</code> HTTP
                      headers that are returned on every API response. For example, if an
                      API has the default hourly limit of 1,000 request, after making 2
                      requests, you will receive this HTTP header in the response of the
                      second request:
                  </p>
                  <p><code>X-RateLimit-Remaining: 998</code></p>
                  <p>The hourly counters for your API key reset on a rolling basis.</p>
                  <p><strong>Example</strong>: If you made 500 requests at 10:15AM and
                      500 requests at 10:25AM, your API key would become temporarily
                      blocked. This temporary block of your API key would cease at
                      11:15AM, at which point you could make 500 requests. At 11:25AM, you
                      could then make another 500 requests.
                  </p>
